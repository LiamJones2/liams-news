# Deployed Version

https://liamsnewsonline.netlify.app/


# General Info

This code uses React, HTML and CSS to make a functioning website that has access to my API holding all the data. A user is able to login, see all the articles, see each topic articles, see an indivual article with all their comments, comment on an article, vote for an article and like or dislike an article.


# How To Use

Go to the website under deployed version. From there you can see all of the articles stored in the database from the API and should be able to go to Login/Signup. Click any of the users under default users and you will be logged in and are now able to explore the website, upvote and comment on articles which will stay there even when you refresh.


Here is the backend that was used for the API: https://github.com/LiamJones2/nc-news
